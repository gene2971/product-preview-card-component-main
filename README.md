# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

That a button is not a link and a link is not a button!!!
It may be confusing , until now , a button does something and a link goes somewhere , although some links look like buttons but they are not !!

### Continued development

I may take on other challenges that may be more difficult
